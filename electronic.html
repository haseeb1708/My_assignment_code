    <b>Computer</b>
    <p>A Computer is an electronic device that processes, stores, and retrieves data, performing a wide range of tasks
        from basic calculations to complex simulations. There are two main types: desktop computers, which are
        stationary and offer powerful performance, and laptops, which are portable. Computers have revolutionized the
        way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. They consist of hardware components like the processor,
        memory, storage, and peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor). With the rise of the internet and software
        applications, computers have become indispensable tools in fields like business, education, research, and
        entertainment, making them a fundamental part of modern life.</p>

    <b>Laptop</b>
    <p>A Laptop is a portable computer designed for mobile use, combining the functionality of a desktop computer with
        the convenience of being lightweight and compact. Laptops are equipped with built-in components like a keyboard,
        screen, touchpad, and battery, making them ideal for students, professionals, and travelers. They come in
        various sizes and configurations, offering different levels of performance based on the user's needs. Laptops
        are perfect for multitasking, online browsing, gaming, and even complex tasks like video editing or coding. With
        advancements in technology, modern laptops are becoming more powerful, with longer battery life and sleeker
        designs, allowing users to work or entertain themselves from anywhere.</p>
