    <b>Shalwar Kameez:</b>
    <p>The Shalwar Kameez is a traditional South Asian outfit, consisting of a long tunic (kameez) and loose trousers
        (shalwar). Originating from the Mughal era, it has become the national dress of countries like Pakistan and a
        popular choice in India and Bangladesh. Known for its comfort, the shalwar kameez is perfect for hot climates
        due to its loose fit and breathable fabric. It is worn during festivals, weddings, and everyday life,
        symbolizing cultural identity and pride. Over time, modern versions have incorporated new fabrics and designs,
        keeping it relevant in contemporary fashion while retaining its traditional appeal.</p>
